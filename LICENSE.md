# Spyderisk Open Project Copyright and Licenses

Regardless of who owns contributions, Spyderisk source code is entirely
licensed under either the Apache2 license or (in some cases) licenses which are
compatible with Apache2. A complete list of licenses is in the README file in
the directory ```licenses/```, which also contains the text of these licenses and
discussion about the Spyderisk policies and practices on incorporating third party
open source code.

As of 2023, the copyright (ownership) of the code in all Spyderisk source trees
is held by either the individual authors, or, quite often, the University of
Southampton ("Soton"). The University of Southampton was the original owner of
nearly all Spyderisk code before it was open sourced in 2023.  For all new
contributions we recommend where possible that the original author retain
copyright ownership as an individual. If you work for an organisation and are
unsure of who owns your output while at work, ask your management. Many files
simply have "Copyright the Spyderisk Authors" at the top.

Spyderisk documentation and source code is generally under a Creative Commons 
license, again explained in ```licenses/```.

# No CLA

Spyderisk does *not* and will not have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA),
for reaons similar to [Red Hat](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/cla-problems),
the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2014/jun/09/do-not-need-cla/) and
other leading open source voices. We adhere to the "inbound = outbound"
principle, where contributors get exactly the same rights as Spyderisk or any
other organisation. We do use the excellent Apache 2 license from
[apache.org](https://apache.org), but apache.org itself is organisation serving
large companies and we do not use their CLAs. We are not affiliated with
apache.org in any way.
