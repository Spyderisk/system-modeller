# Short summary

Spyderisk is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

The [README in the licenses directory](./licenses/README.md) explains how to apply
license headers to files in Spyderisk.

# Spyderisk Open Project Copyright and Licenses

Regardless of who owns contributions, Spyderisk source code is entirely
licensed under either the Apache2 license or (in some cases) licenses which are
compatible with Apache2. A complete list of licenses is in the README file in
the directory [```licenses/```](./licenses/README.md), which also contains the text of these licenses and
discussion about the Spyderisk policies and practices on incorporating open source 
code developed outside Spyderisk.

As of 2023, the copyright (ownership) of the code in all Spyderisk source trees
is held by either the individual authors, or, quite often, the University of
Southampton ("Soton"). The University of Southampton funded the IT Innovation Centre
to create nearly all Spyderisk code before it was open sourced in 2023. For any 
new contributions - and we hope there will be many - we recommend the original author retain
copyright ownership as an individual. If you work for an organisation and are
unsure of who owns your output while at work, ask your management. Many files
simply have "Copyright the Spyderisk Authors" at the top as well as the name of the
original author.

Spyderisk documentation and configuration files are generally under a Creative Commons 
license, again explained in [```licenses/```](./licenses/README.md). It is not necessary 
for every file to have a copyright notice, but in Spyderisk we do insist that all source code
files do.

# No CLA

Spyderisk does *not* and will not have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA),
for reaons similar to [Red Hat](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/cla-problems),
the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2014/jun/09/do-not-need-cla/) and
other leading open source voices.

We adhere to the "inbound = outbound" open source principle, which means:
* each code contributor (ie inbound) has the same rights as every other code contributor.
CLAs often grant additional rights to one particular contributor, which in
the case of Spyderisk would be our generous founding donor, the University of
Southampton. We have chosen not to do this.
* each code user (ie outbound) has exactly the same rights to use Spyderisk source code
as every code contributor.
 
Spyderisk uses the excellent Apache 2 license from
[apache.org](https://apache.org), but apache.org itself is an organisation serving
large companies, and we do not use their CLAs. We are not affiliated with
apache.org in any way.
