# Spyderisk REUSE compliant licensing file

This is the `.reuse` directory, according to the [REUSE specification](https://reuse.software/spec/).

As of 2024, there are still files in the Spyderisk source tree which do not have copyright headers,
or have incorrect headers. In the meantime, and for the avoidance of all doubt, and for the benefit
of automated license scanning software, we have created this directory. In time we will have a correct
[SPDX header](https://spdx.dev/use/specifications/) on every relevant file, or in a .licence file next to the file as per REUSE.

The copyright claimed by the DEP5 file in this directory is Apache2, and we are
quite sure there are no licenses which conflict with this in Spyderisk. In
other words, at worst we have temporarily and legally (but perhaps, impolitely)
relicensed the code of other people. But at least we have audited all code for
the reassurance of all users and licensors - Spyderisk is safe and compliant.
