# Papers and articles

This directory contains the PDFs of papers, articles and reports written by contributors to
the Spyderisk project. These PDFs are referred to throughout the Spyderisk tree, particularly in
the [Spyderisk history document](./../../HISTORY.md) and having them here
ensures the files are always available given the many different academic storage systems the originals are in.
In addition, the PDFs are a single web address that can be crawled by 
sites such as [archive.org](https://archive.org),
rather than a different destination for every [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier).

The authors of papers own their own work and where possible have contributed these articles under the CC-BY-SA license
as described in the top-level [licenses/](../../licences/README.md) directory.
