# This is a multi-stage Docker build file.
# The stages are called "ssm-dev", "ssm-build" and "ssm-production".
# You can choose the stage using "--target <stage>" in a docker command. The default is the final stage.
#   ssm-dev: includes just the build tools we are using
#   ssm-build: copies in the source code and builds it (but does not test it)
#   ssm-production: copies the WAR file from ssm-build into a light-weight "alpine" container and executes Tomcat
# The ssm-dev container is used by developers along with the docker-compose.yml file (which brings in e.g. mongo)
# The ssm-production container can be used in production with the docker-compose-production.yml file (which brings in e.g. mongo)
