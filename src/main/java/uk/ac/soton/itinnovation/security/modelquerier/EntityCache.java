/**
 * Class which allows EntityDB sub-types to be cached. Provides methods of caching, storing, and retrieval.
 * // TODO: This class could do with a refactor
 */
public class EntityCache {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EntityCache.class);

    /* Cache data structures. The idea is that when loaded from the triple store, entities are saved
     * in caches (hash maps), one providing easy access to all entities of each type, the other easy
     * access to an entity with a specific URI.
     * 
     * The maps exist for each graph, because the data could be split betwen graphs.
     * 
     * The cached entities are returned to the JenaQuerierDB and thence to consumer processes, so
     * any changes are made directly on the cached entities.
     * 
     * If a call is received to store an entity, the entity is also added to a hashmap containing
     * entities that need to be stored back to the triple store. That is only done when the cache
     * is synchronised.
     * 
     * The cache is valid for a given entity and graph if that entity is cached in that graph.
     * This is tracked using a hash map using the entity's short URI as a key. This contains a
     * true value if the cache is valid for that entity. A false value or no value indicates an
     * invalid entry, which means the calling process should load it from the underlying DB.
     * 
     * The cache entry starts off in an invalid state (the cache is empty), and undergoes the
     * following state changes:
     * - set to true true once the entity has been loaded and cached
     * - remains true if the entity is stored
     * - remains true if the entity is deleted
     * - reset to false when the cache is cleared, which should only be done after a synch
     * 
     * A store operation just tells the cache that the calling process changed the object, so it
     * should be rewritten to the DB at the next synchronisation. The changes are already in the 
     * cache, so a subsequent request for the same entity just still just return the object.
     * 
     * A delete operation tells the cache that the calling process wants the entity deleted. The
     * cache removes the object from the entities cached and to be stored, and adds it to the
     * entities to be deleted at the next sync(). This means a subsequent request for the same
     * entity will return null, which is valid. We don't want the calling process looking for
     * it in the DB (where it still persists) after deletion.
     * 
     * Note that a delete after a store cancels the store, and a store after a delete cancels the
     * delete. However, a store action doesn't need to remove entities from the deleted list, as
     * they can be removed at the next sync().
     * 
     * The cache is valid for a given cache type and graph if all entities of that type from that
     * graph are cached, and hence there is no need to look in the DB for anything else. The cache
     * type is invalid at the start (the cache is empty) and undergoes the following changes:
     * - set to true if all entities of that type are loaded and cached
     * - set to false when the cache is cleared, which should only be done after a synch
     * - not changed if one or more entities are changed, stored or deleted
     * 
     * Because of this, the method for caching multiple entities has a flag to specify whether it
     * is caching all entities of that type. If set to true, the cache type is valid. If not, the
     * cache type is unchanged.
