# List of Spyderisk contributors

"Contributors" refers to individual people whose work appears in Spyderisk. There are
two kinds of individual contributors:

1. Those listed in the [LICENSORS file](./LICENSORS.md), because as owners
they have the right to license their work as open source. Individuals are
listed there alongside organisations including Yahoo!, Microsoft and the University of Southampton.
2. Those who are listed in this file, who have between them contributed many
thousands of lines of code, but who cannot be licensors because they do not own
the code they have contributed because their employer owns the code instead.

The Spyderisk source trees have been worked on by many people over at least
twelve years at the IT Innovation Centre at the University of Southampton. As
far as we know, anyone who has made commits to one of the Southampton Spyderisk
trees is listed here, some with email addresses that are different from the
ones in the source tree. If you feel you should be listed here but are not,
then please [send us an email](mailto://team@spyderisk.org). You can also contact us
on the [spyderisk-dev mailing list](mailto://spyderisk-dev@jiscmail.ac.uk),
which has [archives online](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A0=SPYDERISK-DEV).

See also [MAINTAINERS-OF-SUBSYSTEMS.md](./MAINTAINERS-OF-SUBSYSTEMS.md) which
